I configured an Auto Scaling Group with a CPU-based scaling policy and attached it to an Application Load Balancer. When traffic increased, CloudWatch showed a spike in CPU utilization, triggering the launch of new EC2 instances. These instances were automatically registered with the Load Balancer and served traffic seamlessly. Once the load dropped, Auto Scaling terminated excess instances to optimize cost.
